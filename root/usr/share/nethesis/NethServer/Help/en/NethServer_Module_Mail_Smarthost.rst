Smarthost
=========

Send mail using a smarthost
    The server will attempt to send emails directly to
    destination (recommended in most cases). Selecting
    instead to sent through a smarthost, it will attempt to deliver them through the 
    ISP's SMTP server (recommended in case of unreliable connection or
    Residential ADSL, dynamic IP, etc).

Host Name
    The name of the mail server of the provider.

Port
    The port of the mail server of the provider.

Username
    If the provider's server requires authentication, specify the 
    username.

Password
    The password required by the provider.

Allow non-encrypted connection
    Normally, if using an authenticated connection (with username and password),
    an encrypted connection is required to protect the password. Selecting this option will
    permit a non-secure connection to connect to the
    provider (not recommended, use only if ISP has problems).
